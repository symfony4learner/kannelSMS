kannelSMS
======

A Symfony 4 project for sending and receiving messages using kannel. Bulk sms possible by sending to all contacts in a table.

Works only on linux.

You should have kannel installed in your computer first before using this.

In the public folder, find the kannel.conf that I used, and modify it to suit your needs.
